# LR-5-state-HMM
This is an implementation of a left-right 5 state Hidden Markov Model for speech recognition.  Each word has a trained HMM where the posterior is modeled after a Gaussian with mean mu and variance sigma square (which we train for).


This is for ECE 417 mutlimedia signals processing taught at UIUC.
